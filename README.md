### Explanation:

- **cmd/**: This contains the entry point of your application. If you have multiple applications (e.g., a server and a CLI tool), each application would have its own subfolder here.
  
- **internal/**: This folder contains internal packages that are not meant to be imported by other projects or outside code. This is ideal for domain-specific logic.

- **pkg/**: This folder contains shared libraries or modules that can be imported by other projects or packages. For example, utility functions or business logic that needs to be reused.

- **api/**: This folder is used for defining the API layers, such as HTTP handlers and business logic for different versions of the API. Each API version would have its own subfolder (e.g., `v1/`, `v2/`).

- **web/**: If your project includes a web interface, this folder would contain HTTP handlers, static assets (like JS, CSS), and templates.

- **scripts/**: This folder holds scripts for tasks like setup, deployment, and other automation tasks.

- **migrations/**: If you're using a database, this folder contains SQL scripts for database migrations.

- **configs/**: This folder holds configuration files for the project (e.g., `.env` files, JSON/YAML configuration).

- **test/**: Contains unit and integration tests for your project. You might also organize tests by the package or feature in this folder.

This structure is flexible and can be modified depending on the scale and nature of your project.
